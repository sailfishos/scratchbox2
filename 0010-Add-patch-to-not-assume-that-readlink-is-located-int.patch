Subject: [PATCH] Add patch to not assume that readlink is located int /bin

On modern systems readlink can be in /usr/bin, so it's better to rely
on $PATH to find it.

The patch has been submited upstream as well, so hopefully it won't be
needed anymore upon the new version release.

Original patch by: Oleg Girko <ol+mer@infoserver.ru>
