This is development code, it is broken. Don't expect to use it for
anything resembling production use. However, I firmly believe this is
infinitely more functional than Scratchbox 1.x can ever be.



INSTALLATION


You need git to work with sbox2, get it from http://git.or.cz/.

Clone the scratchbox 2 repository:

$ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/sbox2


Build using:

$ cd sbox2
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install prefix=$HOME/scratchbox


You need Qemu for cpu-transparency. Unfortunately at the moment no
qemu release works well with SB2, there are patches on qemu-devel
mailing list that help to make the CVS version work, I hope debian's
qemu package incorporates them soon. Meanwhile you're on your own.

If you're targeting ARM and are on a 32bit x86 machine, you can get a 
good toolchain from CodeSourcery:

http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm/download.html


For amd64 systems there's a quite functional toolchain available here:

http://people.freedesktop.org/~lle/arm-lltc-gcc412-glibc25.tar.bz2

Add the compiler to your path before continuing, alternatively you can
give the absolute path to gcc in the sb2-init step below.

Now complete sb2 target setup:

$ mkdir $HOME/buildroot
$ cd $HOME/buildroot
$ $HOME/scratchbox/bin/sb2-init arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc

That will automatically generate a working sb2.config for the compiler
given on the command line.

At this point you can simply run sb2:

$ ../scratchbox/bin/sb2



MAEMO DEVELOPMENT


Download the latest rootstrap from:

http://repository.maemo.org/stable/3.1/armel/maemo-sdk-rootstrap_3.1_armel.tgz

Extract that to $HOME/buildroot

Edit $HOME/buildroot/etc/apt/apt.conf so that it looks like this:
-- snip --
APT {
Architecture armel;
}
-- snip --

Then build a proper libtool for your active toolchain by running 
this inside sb2:

[SB2] $ $HOME/scratchbox/bin/sb2-build-libtool

In order to build debian packages, you have to use -d switch for
dpkg-buildpackage to skip build dependency checking. A proper command line 
would be for example:

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -d


That's all folks, enjoy!
