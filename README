This is development code, it is broken. Don't expect to use it for
anything resembling production use. However, I firmly believe this is
infinitely more functional than Scratchbox 1.x can ever be.

Here are some instructions:

You need git to work with sbox2, get it from http://git.or.cz/.

Clone the scratchbox 2 repository:

$ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/sbox2


Build using:

$ cd sbox2
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install prefix=$HOME/scratchbox


You need Qemu for cpu-transparency. Debian/Etch and Debian/unstable provide
a good one. If all else fails, there's a static qemu-arm-0.8.1-sb2
available on http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fsbox2.

If you're targeting ARM, you can get a good toolchain from CodeSourcery:
http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm/download.html


Now complete sb2 target setup:

$ mkdir $HOME/buildroot
$ cd $HOME/buildroot
$ $HOME/scratchbox/bin/sb2-init arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc

That will automatically generate a working sb2.config for the compiler
given on the command line.

At this point you can simply run sb2:

$ ../scratchbox/bin/sb2


For Maemo (http://www.maemo.org/) development you can download
the latest rootstrap:
http://repository.maemo.org/stable/3.0/armel/maemo-sdk-rootstrap_3.0_armel.tgz)
Extract that to $HOME/buildroot.

Then build a proper libtool for your active toolchain by running 
this inside sb2:

$ $HOME/scratchbox/bin/sb2-build-libtool.sh

In order to build debian packages, you have to use -d switch for
dpkg-buildpackage to skip build dependency checking. A proper
command line would be for example:

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -d


That's all folks, enjoy!
