LICENSING

All files are licensed under GNU LGPL version 2.1 unless specifically 
stated otherwise in the file itself.



GENERAL NOTICE

This is development code, it is broken. Don't expect to use it for
anything resembling production use. However, I firmly believe this is
infinitely more functional than Scratchbox 1.x can ever be.



INSTALLATION

You need git to work with sbox2, get it from http://git.or.cz/.

Clone the scratchbox 2 repository:
$ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/sbox2

There are two ways to build sb2, with and without multilib support.
To be able to run 32bit binaries on a 64bit host, do this:

$ cd sbox2
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make install-multilib prefix=$HOME/scratchbox

If you only want your host's "native" version of the library, do:

$ cd sbox2
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/scratchbox
$ make install


You need Qemu for cpu-transparency. As of 2007-09-11 it's recommended to use
debian/unstable's qemu-0.9.0+20070816-1 (or newer), it's by far the best that
can be used with sb2.

Qemu has many issues on amd64 host systems, at least when trying to
do user-space emulation of ARM. Better results can be achieved on 32bit
i386 hosts.

If you're targeting ARM you can get a good toolchain from CodeSourcery:
http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm/download.html
You need to build sb2 with multilib support to use CodeSourcery toolchains
on amd64 host.

Notice! Old Scratchbox 1 toolchains don't work with sb2.

To use sb2 you need to get a rootfs for your target and put it into
some useful directory, alternatively you can copy the necessary files
into right places from your toolchain. The essential thing is that
sb2 needs FHS compliant target directory structure to work. For an example
of such a system you can look at the Maemo example later in this README.

To complete sb2 target setup:

$ mkdir $HOME/buildroot
$ cd $HOME/buildroot
[extract or copy your rootfs contents into place]
$ $HOME/scratchbox/bin/sb2-init -c qemu-arm my_target arm-linux-gcc

That will automatically generate a working target config for the compiler
given on the command line and run sb2-build-libtool script to get you a
nice working libtool for your compiler. If the sb2-build-libtool part
fails for some reason (incorrect http proxy or something similar), you
can always run it manually later.

At this point you can simply run sb2:

$ $HOME/scratchbox/bin/sb2

sb2-init made this target your default if you had no prior sb2 targets
configured. To change the default use sb2-config -d your_target.

Perhaps adding $HOME/scratchbox/bin to your PATH is also a good idea, put
this in your $HOME/.bashrc:
-- snip --
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/scratchbox/bin
-- snip --

After that you can run sb2 easily from anywhere and it'll just do its magic.



MAEMO DEVELOPMENT

First install sb2 as described above, or if you're using debian testing or
unstable you can simply "apt-get install scratchbox2". If you're running
a non-debian system you need to debootstrap debian/etch to some directory,
sb2 can use it as a tool distribution.

Download the latest rootstrap from:

http://repository.maemo.org/stable/3.1/armel/maemo-sdk-rootstrap_3.1_armel.tgz

Extract that to $HOME/maemo-root

Edit $HOME/maemo-root/etc/apt/apt.conf so that it looks like this:
-- snip --
APT {
Architecture armel;
}
-- snip --

Then get a nice toolchain from the locations mentioned above.

After that you can setup sb2 by running:

$ cd $HOME/maemo-root
$ sb2-init -c qemu-arm -m devel maemo arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc

If you want to use a separate tool distribution, do this instead:
$ sb2-init -c qemu-arm -m devel -t /etch_root maemo arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc

Now you should have a fully functioning development environment.
To try it out you can build for example fontconfig like this:

$ sb2 apt-get source fontconfig
$ cd fontconfig-2.4.1
$ sb2 dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -d

You don't need to be in $HOME/maemo-root to do that, I typically do all
development work in $HOME/src. The "-d" switch is needed to skip checking build
dependencies, this is one of the remaining TODO items of SB2.



DIAGNOSING PROBLEMS WITH SB2

Sometimes everything does not work as expected, so it is good to know
how to locate problems (typically problems are related to misconfigured
mapping rules). Scratchbox 2 can produce extensive logs about all
operations, but it does not do so by default. So the first step is
to enable logging: Use the "-d" or "-L <level>" options of "sb2".

For example,

$ sb2 -L info dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -d

will produce a log of most important actions that were performed by
"dpkg-buildpackage" and all subprocesses started by it. The log will
be created under ~/sb2_logs/ (The above command will also print out the
exact name and location of the logfile.)

The produced logfile can be quite huge, especially when using the higher
logging levels. A logfile analyzer script, sb2-logz, can be used to extract
essentials like error and warning messages and path mapping actions from
the logged information; log level 'info' in enough for anything that
sb2-logz needs. Higher logging levels ('debug', etc) are mostly useful
only for developers of scratchbox 2.

Another useful helper tool is "sb2-show", an utility which can be used to 
test path and command mapping rules while scratchbox 2 is active.

For example,

$ sb2-show path /etc/apt

$ sb2-show -b apt-get path /etc/apt

will show how the /etc/apt database has been mapped. The latter command
uses "apt-get" as the name of the calling program (the results may
be different depending on mapping mode, name of the calling program, etc)

sb2-show can also be used to see how parameters to certain processes will
be modified:

$ sb2-show exec gcc foo.c

shows which "gcc" would be started inside the sb2 session, together with
the actual, possibly modified, arguments. The result depends on how sb2 
was configured (see notes about sb2-init above)
