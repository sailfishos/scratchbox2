This is development code, it is broken. Don't expect to use it for
anything resembling production use. However, I firmly believe this is
infinitely more functional than Scratchbox 1.x can ever be.

Here are some instructions:

You need git to work with sbox2, get it from http://git.or.cz/.

Clone the scratchbox 2 repository:

$ git clone http://rahina.org/repos/sbox2.git


Build using:

$ cd sbox2
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install prefix=$HOME/scratchbox


Set it up:

$ mkdir $HOME/buildroot
$ cp $HOME/scratchbox/share/scratchbox2/sb2.config.sample \
$HOME/buildroot/sb2.config

(at this point you _really_ should go through that file and make sure
it applies to your host system and intended target toolchain). After you're
happy with it you can simply start sb2:

$ cd $HOME/buildroot
$ ../scratchbox/bin/sb2


For Maemo (http://www.maemo.org/) development you can download
the latest rootstrap:
http://repository.maemo.org/stable/3.0/armel/maemo-sdk-rootstrap_3.0_armel.tgz)
Extract that to $HOME/buildroot.

Also get a current toolchain from CodeSourcery:
http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm/download.html
Put that to $HOME/compilers/arm-2006q3 (sb2.config.sample expects this).

Then build a proper libtool for your active toolchain by running this inside
sb2:

$ $HOME/scratchbox/bin/sb2-build-libtool.sh


That's all folks, enjoy!
