    from the rule library
  * A new rule for /sys/fs/selinux is supposed to hide selinux from

scratchbox2 (2.3.53-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New manual page libsb2_interface(7), generated automatically
    from interface.master
  * fixes for /proc and /dev; "emulate" mode now allows simulated 
    devices to be created under /dev
  * Library interface version = 128
  * Improved checking of rules at startup, refuses to start up if
    there were errors
  * A change to mapping rule format:
    Rules which may not have a valid selector ('dir', 'prefix'
    or 'path' may be nil) need to be marked with 'optional_rule = true'
    (fs_rules: rule_file_interface_version = "105" now). Failing to
    do so will generate warnings to sb2d's log. In the future that
    will be an error which will prevent startup.

scratchbox2 (2.3.50-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * No more Lua in libsb2. Lua is now used only in sb2d.
    The runtime "core" of Scratchbox 2 operates now completely
    without the Lua interpreter. Lua is used at session setup
    time from sb2d, but after that, Lua is inactive.
  * All parts of exec postprocessing are now implemented in C,
    except one which was disabled: sbrsh is not anymore available
    as a CPU transparency method.
  * Qemu is the only supported CPU transparency method currently;
    regardless of what has been configured with sb2-init, libsb2
    assumes it is Qemu.
  * The old Lua-related files are still there, and there is 
    dead code in the C files, too. Those are now waiting for a
    bigger cleanup.

scratchbox2 (2.3.49-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adapted the host-static-binaries-with-Qemu feature [from
    Rafal Krypa, for the 2.2 version] for 2.3; the code is
    now there, but haven't been fully tested yet.
  * A new internal tool, sb2dctl, for sending messages to sb2d
    (used for intelnal purposes)
  * Introduced init2.lua, which is executed by sb2d when
    finilizing session setup. It is used for loading CPU 
    transparency settings to the rule tree (those
    variables are now loaded to the rule tree, but not yet
    used for anything)

  * The rule tree DB is now completely initialized by sb2d
    (the "sb2" command does not anymore execute any Lua files
    with "sb2-show execluafile")
  * Exec code: Postrocessing of dynamically linked native
    binaries is now implemented in C (old code (Lua 
    function sb_execve_postprocess_native_executable())
    is still there, but not used.)

    changes in other subsystems (pathmapping, etc)

  * Better simulation of root's privileges in open(), fopen(), etc:

    and read read-protected files (if file owner == real EUID)
  * Added wrapper for dup3()
  * A bugfix to real_fstatat()

  * Important change to command-line parameter handling:
    the "sb2" command now prevents re-evaluation of command
    line parameters which are passed to the commands running
    inside the session. It also preserves whitespace in such
    parameters (previously, an extra shell was used there,
    but that has been eliminated completely now)

scratchbox2 (2.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  [ Lauri Aarnio ]
  * NOTE: this is the first usable test version in the 2.3-development
    series; this is still alpha-level quality, and even if it seems
    to work quite well in my test environment, more testing is 
    still needed.
  * Highlights of the changes:
  - "accel" mode replaced "devel" mode. Both names can be used,
    but they refer to the same thing.
  - "install" and "maemo_simple" modes were removed; these have not
    been maintained since 2009, as far as I know. Please let us know
    if these are still needed for something.
  - Added proto-level support for union directories; added some
    rules to the accel/devel mode that will use union directories
    for aclocal and pkg-config (making an union from selected subdirs
    from the target- and tools directories).
  - Mapping modes were reorganized; rule files were split to two
    parts (separate files for pathmapping- and exec policy rules),
    and other mode-specific configuration files were moved, too.
  - There are changes to the mapping rule format; The new one is
    simpler and makes some planned future enhancements possible.
    Most notably, the old "chains" layer was eliminated completely
    from pathmapping rules.
  - There are some cleanups and code reorganizations in the "engine
    room" as well. In particular, the pathmapping code (in C) was moved
    to a new subdirectory and split to modules (one file/module).
