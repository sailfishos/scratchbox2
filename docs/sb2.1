.SH NAME

will always return the real path.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
There are quite many environment variables being used. Since sb2 is still
very volatile, the best documentation is in the source of sb2 script itself.

.SH CONFIGURATION
To configure sb2, do something like this:

.nf
mkdir $HOME/buildroot
cd $HOME/buildroot
[fetch a rootfs from somewhere and extract it here]
sb2-init -c /abs/path/to/qemu-arm /path/to/cross-compiler/bin/arm-linux-gcc
.fi

To change default scratchbox2 target:

sb2-config -d another_target
