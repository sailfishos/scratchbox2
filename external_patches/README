"external_patches" for SB2:
===========================

This directory contains patches to external components that are recommended
to be used in the SB2'ed environment.

These patches are needed when:

a) target CPU archictecture is the same as host CPU architecture;
   i.e. when sb2 is used without Qemu.

b) these are also recommended for tools, when the tools are not used
   from the host OS (which is usually the case with "accel" and "devel" modes)

c) The host OS contains buggy components (this currently applies to
   64-bit Ubuntu Lucid; see detailed description below)

GDB pathces:
============

gdb-7.0.1+sb2.patch
-------------------

	From: Gergely Risko <gergely@risko.hu>
	
	The main problem is that sb2 wraps exec and instead of execve'ing the
	executable, it uses ld-linux.so.2 to do the loading.  This way the
	kernel only maps ld-linux.so.2, and the mmapping of the real binary is
	done by ld-linux.so.2 itself.  Thus the kernel raises SIGTRAP as soon as
	ld-linux.so.2 is mmapped, but by this time the real binary is not in the
	memory, setting breakpoints fail.

	My solution is two minimal modifications in libsb2 and gdb.

	Gdb has a
	#define START_INFERIOR_TRAPS_EXPECTED 2
	in gdb/inferior.h, which specifies that 2 SIGTRAPs will be raised, and
	then we are really debugging the wanted process.  The first SIGTRAP is
	from the shell, which is used in GDB to make e.g.
	run *
	possible (where * is expanded by the shell).  I just increased this
	constant to 4.  I also set a new environment variable SBOX_SIGTRAP to 1
	in the shell started by GDB.

	In libsb2 I added to the initialization a check.  If SBOX_SIGTRAP is
	set, then we do a raise(SIGTRAP).

	So the whole process is this:
	gdb forks
	  ptrace(TRACME)
	  execve("/bin/sh", ["-e", "./mybin"], {SBOX_SIGTRAP => "1", ...})
	    libsb2 wraps this exec:
	    exec("ld-linux.so.2", ["/bin/sh", "-e", "exec ./mybin"])  -> 1 SIGTRAP
	      libsb2.so gets loaded for the shell, constructor gets called,
	      the constructor notes the SBOX_SIGTRAP               -> 1 SIGTRAP
	      shell exec's the mybin                               -> 1 SIGTRAP
	      libsb2.so preload constructor notes SBOX_SIGTRAP     -> 1 SIGTRAP
	<-
	gdb parent already got 4 SIGTRAPs, so it starts putting in breakpoints
	and everything.

	Pro: no gdb wrapper, user can start putting breakpoints right away after
	gdb startup, no special handling of gdb is needed inside sb2.

	Con: modification in both gdb and libsb2.

	-=-

	GDB can follow exec calls, see (info "(gdb) Processes").

	To support this, SB2 has to reintroduce SBOX_SIGTRAP if it
	going to be lost because the program called exec*e without
	specifying SBOX_SIGTRAP in the new env.  This is done in
	preload/sb-exec.c:prepare_envp_for_do_exec.

	In GDB we have to wait for an extra SIGTRAP after every time,
	the inferior called exec(), the modification for this is made
	in gdb/infrun.c.


GLIBC/EGLIBC pathces:
=====================
[NOTE: patches for glibc/eglibc should be applied in this order:]

ldconfig patch
--------------
[available for eglibc-2.10]
	A bugfix for "ldconfig" (eglibc 2.10). The bug exists in 2.8, too.
	Version 2.5 was ok.

elf/rtld.c --argv0 option patch
-------------------------------
[available for glibc-2.3.6, glibc-2.5, eglibc-2.8, eglibc-2.10, glibc-2.14.1]

	A small patch for the dynamic linker/loader ("ld.so", also known as
	"ld-linux.so"). The dynamic linker is part of the "glibc" package.

	This patch adds one command line option which is only used
	when the dynamic linker is started as an ordinary program,
	which is a seldom used way to start dynamically linked
	programs. SB2 uses that option to preserve semantics of the
	exec* calls

	[SB2 starts the dynamic linker as an ordinary program,
	to be able to get full control of the execution environment -
	this is somewhat complex system. Study the implementation
	of SB2's exec-related functions for full details]

	Note that this patch causes no harm in the default case, i.e.
	when the dynamic linker is started "automatically" by the kernel.

ld.so --rpath-prefix option patch
---------------------------------
[available for glibc-2.5, eglibc-2.8, eglibc-2.10, glibc-2.14.1]
	
	This patch adds a new option "--rpath-prefix" to ld.so.
	This makes it possible to add a prefix to all RPATH and
	RUNPATH options from binaries and libraries; that way 
	Scratchbox 2 can run also host-compatible binaries that
	contain such options (without this, the RPATHs would
	refer to the libraries on the host system and not to
	the correct libraries under 'target_root').

	Note that this patch causes no harm in the default case, i.e.
	when the dynamic linker is started "automatically" by the kernel.

/etc/nsswitch.conf location selection patch
-------------------------------------------
[available for glibc-2.5, eglibc-2.8, eglibc-2.10, glibc-2.14.1]
	This patch makes location of the /etc/nsswitch.conf file
	to be run-time configurable via an environment variable.

	This is needed for correct operation with Scratchbox 2.
	Without this, the sb2-virtualized environment will
	always read /etc/nsswitch.conf from the host.

nscd socket location selection patch
---------------------------------------
[available for glibc-2.5, eglibc-2.8, eglibc-2.10, glibc-2.14.1]
	This patch makes location of nscd's socket to be run-time
	configurable via an environment variable.

ld.so --nodefaultdirs option patch
--------------------------------------------
[available for glibc-2.5, eglibc-2.8, eglibc-2.10, glibc-2.14.1]
	Adds a new option "--nodefaultdirs" to ld.so.

	This option disables searching from the default directories
	(/lib,/usr/lib) and also disables use of ld.so's search
	cache.

	This is recommended for correct operation with Scratchbox 2;
	without this, libraries may be incorrectly loaded from the
	host environment (such libraries that are missing from
	the "scratchboxed" environment but are present in the host)

	has been reported but haven't been fixed (Dec 16, 2010);
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fakeroot/+bug/571091

	To fix the problem:
	- get the sources (atp-get source fakeroot)
	- apply the patch
