"external_patches" for SB2:
===========================

This directory contains patches to external components that are recommended
to be used in the SB2'ed environment.

Unless otherwise noted, these patches are needed only when target CPU
archictecture is the same as host CPU architecture; i.e. when sb2 is
used without Qemu.

Short description of the files:

gdb-7.0.1+sb2.patch
-------------------

	From: Gergely Risko <gergely@risko.hu>
	
	The main problem is that sb2 wraps exec and instead of execve'ing the
	executable, it uses ld-linux.so.2 to do the loading.  This way the
	kernel only maps ld-linux.so.2, and the mmapping of the real binary is
	done by ld-linux.so.2 itself.  Thus the kernel raises SIGTRAP as soon as
	ld-linux.so.2 is mmapped, but by this time the real binary is not in the
	memory, setting breakpoints fail.

	My solution is two minimal modifications in libsb2 and gdb.

	Gdb has a
	#define START_INFERIOR_TRAPS_EXPECTED 2
	in gdb/inferior.h, which specifies that 2 SIGTRAPs will be raised, and
	then we are really debugging the wanted process.  The first SIGTRAP is
	from the shell, which is used in GDB to make e.g.
	run *
	possible (where * is expanded by the shell).  I just increased this
	constant to 4.  I also set a new environment variable SBOX_SIGTRAP to 1
	in the shell started by GDB.

	In libsb2 I added to the initialization a check.  If SBOX_SIGTRAP is
	set, then we do a raise(SIGTRAP).

	So the whole process is this:
	gdb forks
	  ptrace(TRACME)
	  execve("/bin/sh", ["-e", "./mybin"], {SBOX_SIGTRAP => "1", ...})
	    libsb2 wraps this exec:
	    exec("ld-linux.so.2", ["/bin/sh", "-e", "exec ./mybin"])  -> 1 SIGTRAP
	      libsb2.so gets loaded for the shell, constructor gets called,
	      the constructor notes the SBOX_SIGTRAP               -> 1 SIGTRAP
	      shell exec's the mybin                               -> 1 SIGTRAP
	      libsb2.so preload constructor notes SBOX_SIGTRAP     -> 1 SIGTRAP
	<-
	gdb parent already got 4 SIGTRAPs, so it starts putting in breakpoints
	and everything.

	Pro: no gdb wrapper, user can start putting breakpoints right away after
	gdb startup, no special handling of gdb is needed inside sb2.

	Con: modification in both gdb and libsb2.

glibc-2.3.6-elf-rtld.c.patch, glibc-2.5-elf-rtld.c.patch,
glibc-2.8-elf-rtld.c.patch
--------------------------------------------------------

	A small patch for the dynamic linker/loader ("ld.so", also known as
	"ld-linux.so"). The dynamic linker is part of the "glibc" package.

	This patch adds one command line option which is only used
	when the dynamic linker is started as an ordinary program,
	which is a seldom used way to start dynamically linked
	programs. SB2 uses that option to preserve semantics of the
	exec* calls

	[SB2 starts the dynamic linker as an ordinary program,
	to be able to get full control of the execution environment -
	this is somewhat complex system. Study the implementation
	of SB2's exec-related functions for full details]

	Note that this patch causes no harm in the default case, i.e.
	when the dynamic linker is started "automatically" by the kernel.

glibc-2.5-ld.so-rpath-prefix-option.patch,
glibc-2.8-ldso-rpath-prefix-option.patch
-----------------------------------------
	
	This patch adds a new option "--rpath-prefix" to ld.so.
	This makes it possible to add a prefix to all RPATH and
	RUNPATH options from binaries and libraries; that way 
	Scratchbox 2 can run also host-compatible binaries that
	contain such options (without this, the RPATHs would
	refer to the libraries on the host system and not to
	the correct libraries under 'target_root').

	Note that this patch causes no harm in the default case, i.e.
	when the dynamic linker is started "automatically" by the kernel.

glibc-2.5-nsswitchconf-location.patch,
glibc-2.8-nsswitchconf-location.patch
-------------------------------------
	This patch makes location of the /etc/nsswitch.conf file
	to be run-time configurable via an environment variable.

	This is needed for correct operation with Scratchbox 2.
	Without this, the sb2-virtualized environment will
	always read /etc/nsswitch.conf from the host.

glibc-2.5-nscd-socket-location
glibc-2.8-nscd-socket-location.patch
------------------------------
	This patch makes location of nscd's socket to be run-time
	configurable via an environment variable.

glibc-2.5-ldso-nodefaultdirs-option
glibc-2.8-ldso-nodefaultdirs-option.patch
-----------------------------------
	Adds a new option "--nodefaultdirs" to ld.so.

	This option disables searching from the default directories
	(/lib,/usr/lib) and also disables use of ld.so's search
	cache.

	This is recommended for correct operation with Scratchbox 2;
	without this, libraries may be incorrectly loaded from the
	host environment (such libraries that are missing from
	the "scratchboxed" environment but are present in the host)
