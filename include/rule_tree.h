/* A Rule Tree is a shared-memory repository of mapping-
 * and other kind of rules for SB2.
 *
 * The rule tree is created when a session is created,
 * by writing entries to a file. Once created, it isn't
 * modified anymore - the client processes will mmap() it
 * to memory, and use it (R/O) without locking anything.
 *
 * Since the file may be mapped to any address, pointers
 * can not be used in the rule tree. Instead, offsets 
 * (relative to the beginning of the file) are used.
